# Username Color Cycler
This script will change the color of your username in Twitch chat every time you post.

## Chrome Users
Chrome users will have to install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) in order to use this script.

## Firefox Users
Firefox users will have to install the [Greasemonky add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) in order to use this script.

## Using the script
Once you have installed the correct extension/add-on for your browser, go to [http://kaloncpu57.github.io/youtube-scripts/video-looper/loop.user.js](http://kaloncpu57.github.io/youtube-scripts/video-looper/loop.user.js) and you should be asked to install the script. If you are not asked to install it automatically, you can add a script yourself and just copy/paste the script in.
